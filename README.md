# Anime-Project
# Description
In this project we created a page that you can search for a data about animes show.
In the main page we used an API to get data about 300 anime shows and use java script to do filter on the search.
In the user page we used another API to display it epart of the main.
Also we created a login page and singin page using the local storage methods(set,get).
The style and responssive pages created by bootstrap , media query and scss.
# Project Flow
* Difficulties:
1. API the api searching took to much time and the api that i find limited me in terms of his ideas.
* What was goood:
* 1.Style there is a lot of html and style in this project u used boostrap for the most of the page style.
